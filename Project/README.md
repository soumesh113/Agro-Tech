 Farming and Agriculture are some of the most important industries in India, especially keeping in mind the fast growing population in our nation. However, inspite of this,
 farmers throughout the nation are suffering from poverty and they get exploited on a daily basis by many wholesellers and middle-men. Moreover, due to outdated knowledge,
 farmers are not able to keep up with the newest growing practices and conditions for crops. Thus in order to help relieve farmers of such problems, we have created this website,
 which will help farmers to know which crops they should be growing according to their conditions, the fertilizers they should be using, and it will also enable them to directly
 and easily buy and trade farming equipment with other farmers, as well as crops, without any middle men deceiving them.
 
 Firstly, in order to use our features, users will need to sign up, and then login to our website by filling forms respectively.
 
 Main Pages:
 
 Equipments:
 
 This page enables farmers to buy farming equipment from other farmers. The equipments that are up for sale will be clearly available on the website, and the users can conveniently
 add them to their cart and order them. They can also easily sort through the items using our filters. They can sort equipment by name and by prices. They can also put up their
 own equipments for sale by filling a form.
 
 Predictions: 
 
 This page enables farmers to find out which crop they should grow based on the nutrient content in their soil and ph. With the help of this information, as well as the
 location of the farmers which they already entered while registering, our ML model will recommend the best crop to be grown, and similarly, based on the above information
 as well as the soil type and crop type, we will also display the best fertilizer to be applied. Thus with the help of this much information, farmers will get to see which crop
 they should grow and which fertilizer should be used.
 
 Trading:
 
 This page enables farmers to engage in crop trading with clear prices and full transparency, without any ambiguity or middle-men or wholesalers to deceive them. They can
 put up crops for sale easily by filling a farm, and others can conveniently engage in trading with them.
